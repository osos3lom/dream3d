/** GitHub Pages serves a project site from `/<repo>/`, so the bundle is built
 *  against that prefix. `VITE_BASE` overrides it for a custom domain or a
 *  differently named fork (`VITE_BASE=/ npm run build`).
 *
 *  The base is applied unconditionally: `vite preview` reports `command:
 *  "serve"` just like `vite dev`, so branching on `command` would serve the
 *  production bundle from `/` while its own HTML pointed at `/dream3d/`. Dev
 *  therefore also runs under the subpath, which is what we want — it is the
 *  same shape the deployment has. */

/** GitHub Pages is a plain file server with no rewrite rules, so a direct hit
 *  on `/dream3d/ar` — a deep link, or simply a refresh — finds no file and is
 *  answered with `404.html`. Serving a copy of the app there hands the URL to
 *  React Router, which renders the right route. The status line is still 404,
 *  which is invisible to the visitor and keeps crawlers from indexing routes
 *  that do not exist.
 *
 *  `.nojekyll` stops Pages running the uploaded output through Jekyll, which
 *  would drop any file or directory whose name begins with an underscore. */
/** The dev and preview servers mount the app under `base`, so opening the
 *  origin root gets a blank page — which is exactly what a preview pane does
 *  when it opens `http://localhost:<port>`. Send `/` on to the base path
 *  instead. Dev-time only; it never ships. */
